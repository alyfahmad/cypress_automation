1. Download and Install nodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Go to This PC → Properties → Advanced System Settings → Environment Variables → System Variables → Path
3. Click edit and check if nodeJS is available for the path variable
4. Open command prompt and run the following commmands and they should return a version number
   1. node --version
   2. npm --version
5. Download and Install Visual Studio Code
6. If package.json is not available run the following command
   npm -i init
7. Then install cypress by running the following command
   npm install cypress --save -dev
8. To open cypress use the following command
   npx cypress open
9. To run your test cases through command prompt use the following commands
   npx cypress run # this will run the program in headless mode
   npx cypress run --headed # this will run the program in headed mode
   npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/mytest.cy.js --headed # this will run the defined specification file
   npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/mytest.cy.js --headed --browser chrome # this will run the defined specification file in the defined browser
10. add "/// <reference types="Cypress" />" to the command.js file in support which allows us to leverage VS Code Intellisense for the autocompletion
11. To use Xpaths as locators in cypress we need to install a plugin (cypress-xpath) from https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/xpath
    after installation add
    "require('@cypress/xpath');
    /// <reference types="cypress-xpath" />" to the command.js file in support


Some issues i faced during the development and how i resolved it:
1. I was facing an issue with xpath where the dropdown element would change state and close out when i clicked on it's Xpath. As a result i was not able to find
the details under that element.
Solution: I used breakpoint on attribute from the chrome dev tool and changed the parent div state to show the dropdown content. I went ahead with breakpoint steps until the dropdown was visible and then expanded the contents to see element details.

2. I was facing an issue in cypress where my "it" test cases were acting independently. So, i had to perform the initial steps over and over again. 
Solution: I found that this was caused by a configuration in cypress.config.js file called testIsolation. When it is set to true the behavior is like that. document: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-isolation
at the end i went with a solution to add suite specific isolation configuration as one of my suites supported isolation while others didn't.


-- Selectorshub is a great chrome extension which can be used to identify xpath
